### Implementation Notes

The memory management implementation adds intelligent features that mimic human memory:

- **Enhanced Engram Schema**: Added importance, access_count, last_accessed, and ttl fields to track usage patterns
- **Temporal Organization**: Created multi-granular time-based indexing for efficient temporal queries
- **Importance Scoring**: Implemented a sophisticated algorithm combining centrality, access patterns, and recency
- **Forgetting Mechanisms**: Added configurable policies to prune less important memories based on various criteria
- **Memory Health Tools**: Created utilities to analyze memory graph health and provide pruning recommendations
- **Access Tracking**: Added systems to track and leverage access patterns for optimizing retrieval
- **TTL Support**: Implemented automatic expiration for ephemeral information

### Test Coverage

Comprehensive test suite added for memory management features:
- Created tests for TemporalIndex operations (year/month/day/hour indexing)
- Added tests for ImportanceIndex operations (importance calculations)
- Implemented tests for various ForgettingPolicy implementations
- Added integration tests for the enhanced Engram schema with memory management fields

## Implementation Notes

### Core Schema Implementation
We've successfully implemented the core schema types (Engram, Connection, Collection, Agent, Context) from the Python prototype in Rust. Each type has proper serialization/deserialization support using serde, and includes the same functionality as the original Python classes.

### Storage Layer
The RocksDB storage implementation provides:
- Persistent key-value storage for all entity types
- Column family organization to separate different entity types
- Transaction support for atomic operations
- Error handling for common failure cases

### In-Memory Graph Layer
The petgraph-based memory graph implementation provides:
- Fast in-memory representation of the knowledge graph
- Support for typed edges between nodes
- Efficient querying of relationships between engrams
- Access control for multi-agent setups

### CLI Tool
The command-line interface provides:
- Commands for adding and retrieving engrams
- Connection creation and management
- Collection and agent operations
- Basic query capabilities

## Next Steps

1. Complete the export/import functionality for data backup and migration
2. Enhance indexing for more efficient relationship traversal
3. Add data maintenance commands to the CLI
4. Improve documentation with detailed design decisions
5. Add TUI support with ratatui for better user experience

## Testing Status

Basic unit tests for the core schema types have been implemented. Additional integration tests are needed for the storage and graph layers.

## Performance Considerations

While the current implementation provides the core functionality, there are several opportunities for optimization:
- Improve index design for faster graph traversal
- Optimize serialization for large collections
- Enhance transaction handling for better concurrency
