# CLI Reference

EngramAI Lite provides a comprehensive command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the memory graph. This document describes all available commands and their usage.

## Starting the CLI

```bash
# Start with default database location
engramlt

# Specify a custom database path
engramlt --db-path /path/to/database
```

## Command Categories

The CLI commands are organized into the following categories:

- Creation Commands: Add new data to the memory graph
- Retrieval Commands: Get specific data from the memory graph
- List Commands: Show multiple items of a specific type
- Relationship Commands: Manage connections between items
- Data Maintenance Commands: Maintain and optimize the database
- Import/Export Commands: Backup and restore data
- System Commands: Basic system operations
